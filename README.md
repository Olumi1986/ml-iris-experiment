# Small ML Experiment – Iris Dataset

## Objective
This project compares three classification models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and a small Neural Network—on the Iris dataset to understand their performance on a structured dataset.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Small Neural Network (MLP)

## Dataset
- Iris dataset (150 samples, 3 classes)
- 75% training / 25% testing split

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Files
- ML_Iris_Experiment.ipynb – full experiment notebook
- ML_Iris_Project_Summary_Olukenyo.pdf – 1-page summary
